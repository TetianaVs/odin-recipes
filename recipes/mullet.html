    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing your jewelled wild rice. Cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside while you work on your fish.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Slash the mullet skin three to four times (don’t cut too far into the flesh). Pop a few sprigs of lemon thyme into each cavity and season well.</li>
        <li>Wrap the head of each fish in a slice of pancetta and drizzle with a little olive oil. Pop the fish on a large roasting tin and roast for 12 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make your tapenade. Drain and soak the olives in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes. Drain well, then remove the stones.</li>
        <li> Peel the garlic, then bash in a pestle and mortar with the dried chilli flakes and fennel seeds until fine. Tip into a bowl.</li>
        <li> Roughly chop the almonds, olives and sundried tomato and add to the bowl, followed by the spice mix and extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Tip the rice into a large bowl. Halve and bash the pomegranate with a spoon so the seeds fall into the bowl.</li>
        </ol>
